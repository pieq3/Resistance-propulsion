This repository contains the scripts for the 'Resistenza e Propulsione' (Resistance and Propulsion) course at University of Trieste. It contains Python scripts that allow to solve some academic exercises such as the ITTC '57 procedures.
List of exercises:

1. ITTC '57 procedures with some sample data;
2. ITTC '78 procedures with some sample data and a comparison with some statistical formulae;
3. Showing how waves' general formulae come to the Airy model (infinite depth) with high depths (with some significant diagrams);
